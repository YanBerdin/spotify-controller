# Soundify : Spotify Controller

## `🛠 Under construction 🏗`

- Minimal setup to get React working in Vite
- Discovery and Learning of styled-components
- Warning: The use of all Spotify features requires a Premium account

## Create an Application

First, we need to create a Spotify App to give us credentials to authenticate with the API.

- Go to your Spotify Developer Dashboard and log in.
- Click Create an App.
- Fill out the name and description and click create.
- Click Show Client Secret.
- Save your Client ID and Secret.
- Click Edit Settings.
- Add <http://localhost:5173> as a redirect URI.

All done! You now have a properly configured Spotify application and the correct credentials to make requests.

## Running Locally

```bash
cd soundify
npm install
npm run dev
```
